# Chromis viridis lcWGS

This repository outlines the roadmap we followed to move *Chromis viridis* through the [Low Coverage Whole Genome Sequencing Pipeline](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_lcwgs_data_processing). This provides steps taken & analysis we did to gain insight on the historical population demography of this very popular aquarium fish, also known as the green chromis.

## 1. Completed fq.gz pre-processing

The [pire_fq_gz_processing](https://github.com/philippinespire/pire_fq_gz_processing) instructions and scripts (Garcia et al 2021) were used. The purpose of the preprocessing pipeline was to Trim, deduplicate, decontaminate, and repair the raw `fq.gz` files.

After checking whether runFQSCRN_6.bash worked, I found that there was an error:

```
slurm-fqscrn.1735299.2.out:No reads in Cvi-APal_002-Ex1-1B-lcwgs-1-2.clmp.fp2_r1.fq.gz, skipping
slurm-fqscrn.1735299.5.out:No reads in Cvi-APal_003-Ex1-1C-lcwgs-1-2.clmp.fp2_r2.fq.gz, skipping
```

So I ran FQSCRN again for the 2 individual sequences:
```
bash /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_fq_gz_processing/runFQSCRN_6.bash fq_fp1_clmp_fp2 fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn 1 Cvi-APal_002-Ex1-1B-lcwgs-1-2.clmp.fp2_r1.fq.gz
bash /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_fq_gz_processing/runFQSCRN_6.bash fq_fp1_clmp_fp2 fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn 1 Cvi-APal_003-Ex1-1C-lcwgs-1-2.clmp.fp2_r2.fq.gz
```

There were no more errors or failed individuals so I ran Multiqc for all samples again

## 2. Copied the Reference Genome into the species folder

I copied the best assembly from the ssl pipeline (see link below) and renamed it to reference.ssl.Cvi.fasta that was copied into the refGenome folder
```
/home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_ssl_data_processing/chromis_viridis/SPAdes_Cvi-CPal-A_decontam_R1R2_noIsolate/scaffolds.fasta
```

## 3. Mapped & Filtered BAM files

<details><summary><i>mkBAM step</i></summary>
Created mkBAM folder & linked fq.gz files from fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn_repaired:

```
cd /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_lcwgs_data_processing/chromis_viridis/2nd_sequencing_run
mkdir mkBAM
ln fq_fp1_clmp_fp2_fqscrn_rprd/*fq.gz mkBAM
```

Copied dDocent config file & edited it to suit the lcwgs data
```
cp /home/e1garcia/shotgun_PIRE/pire_lcwgs_data_processing/sphaeramia_nematoptera/1st_sequencing_run/mkBAM/config.6.lcwgs .
```

After changing the settings, I executed this command:
```
sbatch ../../../dDocentHPC/dDocentHPC_dev2.sbatch mkBAM config.6.lcwgs
```
